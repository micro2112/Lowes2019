# Lowes2019

Recently the Lowes price tracker tool stopped working. 
The original greasyfork location is dead and all hope was lost. 

I had some time and decided to try to update it myself. 


I create this repo to host the new version.

# Issues Reported
* OCT 2021 - Script is down again. Lowes updated again.

## How to use. 
 When you are on a product page, the Check Price button will appear.

 You will then see the main landing page
 
 Find stores button generates a GIANT list that needs reformatted into this script. 
 
 If you find a store missing report an issue here and I can update the list.
